## Description

The purpose of this script is to monitor store websites to monitor for product availability, in instances of limited product availability. The script is intended to be utilized in the terminal. It is not an application, but rather a module that can be further developed to create a fully functional product checkout bot. Upon running the script, timestamps and colour coordinated information will be shown if whether the product is in stock or not. The script is developed specifically for monitoring websites for the Playstation 5 gaming console; however, it can be changed to essentially monitor any website for any product given the correct CSS selectors, and URL details are changed within the code appropriately.
